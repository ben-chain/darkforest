      <h2>Welcome to the Dark Forest tutorial!</h2>
      <p>
        Dark Forest is a space conquest game built on Ethereum using
        <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">zkSNARKs</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p>
        Connect to Ropsten on MetaMask and load up
        <a href="http://zkga.me">http://zkga.me</a>. If you are participating in
        the contest, please also fill out
        <a href="https://forms.gle/dwH1nQaymhSgmfrj8">this Google form</a> to
        claim your winnings once the game has ended.
      </p>

      <h2>Contest Rules</h2>

      <p>
        A pool of e (2.718) ETH will be distributed at the end of 48 hours based
        on the following calculations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reward for playing:</li>
        <li class="indent">
          reward = (forces_owned / total_forces) * 2.718 ETH
        </li>
        <li>Simulated "transaction fees":</li>
        <li class="indent">cost = number_transactions * 0.25 USD</li>
        <li>Total prize:</li>
        <li class="indent">sum = max(reward - cost, 0)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We encourage you to be hacky, and to write code to gain an advantage
        (see "Hints"). However, any hack that is clearly not in the spirit of
        the game (please use sensible discretion) may be grounds for
        disqualification. If in doubt, please ask!
      </p>

      <h2>How to Play</h2>

      <p>
        You will be spawned at a home planet at a random location in the
        universe.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Click-and-drag</u> from one planet to another to send forces.
        </li>
        <li><u>Click-and-drag</u> on the map to pan around.</li>
        <li><u>Scroll</u> to zoom in and out.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can move forces from one of your own planets to another, conquer
        unowned planets, or attack enemy planets. Attacking enemy planets with
        enough forces will allow you to conquer them.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can change how many forces to send from one planet to another in the
        "Forces" tab.
      </p>

      <h2>Planet Details</h2>

      <p>
        Planets you own are denoted with a blue ring. Enemy planets have a red
        ring.
      </p>

      <p>Planets have various stats, shown in the "Details" tab:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Capacity: total # of forces that can be occupied on this planet</li>
        <li>Growth: represents maximum growth rate</li>
        <li>
          Attack: how much damage per unit of forces attacks from this planet do
        </li>
        <li>Defense: how resistant your planet is to enemy attacks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Larger planets have higher attack, smaller planets have higher defense.
      </p>

      <h2>Miners</h2>

      <p>
        The web client uses a "miner" to uncover the locations of planets and
        players in the universe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your miner can explore space in different patterns, controllable in the
        "Miners" tab.
      </p>

      <h2>Hints</h2>

      <p>
        The universe is a 8192 x 8192 grid of cells. Each cell (x, y) is
        uniquely identified by its hash, MiMC(x, y). Rather than publishing the
        coordinates of planets they own, planets publish the hashes of planets
        to the blockchain, along with Zero-Knowledge Proofs that the planets are
        legitimate. In this way, player locations are kept secret, up to brute
        force computation.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Planets" exist at all cells whose coordinates hash to under a
        difficulty threshold specified in the Dark Forest Ethereum contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        The web client miner lifts the "cryptographic fog of war" on the
        universe by computing hashes. These hashes are stored in browser local
        storage (IndexedDB). Note that you may compute hashes offline and enter
        them into local storage yourself as well.
